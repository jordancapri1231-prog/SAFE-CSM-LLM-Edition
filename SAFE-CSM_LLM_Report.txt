Abstract

The SAFE-CSM (LLM Edition) provides a non-adaptive, observation-based framework for evaluating contextual stability in large language models.
The module assesses stability through six normalized external factors and an interpretable difference measure Δφ, without accessing or inferring any internal mechanisms.
A minimal scalar model (θ ∈ [0,1]) is used to illustrate typical LLM output tendencies such as fixation, collapse, and directional drift.
All parameters are fixed or randomized for SAFE compliance.
This document provides the core description of the LLM Edition and the accompanying materials included in the project archive.

1. Overview

The Context Stabilization Module (SAFE-CSM) is designed to observe and evaluate the external stability of language model outputs.
It does not access, infer, or approximate internal generative mechanisms.
Instead, it provides a reproducible method to quantify stability using normalized factors derived solely from observable output behavior.

The LLM Edition of SAFE-CSM introduces a minimal scalar model that represents model output tendencies along a one-dimensional axis θ ∈ [0,1].
This model is used exclusively for demonstration and educational purposes.

2. Evaluation Factors

SAFE-CSM evaluates six normalized factors:

J_info

J_logic

J_affect

J_norm

J_style

J_reflex

These factors serve as independent, abstract indicators of output balance.

The stability index Δφ is defined as:

Δφ = | J_affect – J_reflex |


This difference is used only as an observable indicator of contextual drift.

A composite stability score is defined as:

J_total = mean(Js) × (1 – Δφ)


All values are randomized or fixed for demonstration.

3. Minimal External Model for LLM Output

The LLM Edition uses a minimal scalar model:

θ ∈ [0, 1]


θ is interpreted only as an external measure of output direction.

LLM-like fluctuations are simulated by adding random noise and a slight tendency toward extreme values.
SAFE-CSM applies a small fixed corrective bias within a predefined band:

LOW = 0.2

HIGH = 0.8

This minimal model does not represent internal logic.
It is strictly an external representation used to illustrate observable patterns.

4. Stability Patterns

SAFE-CSM demonstrates three external stability patterns commonly seen in LLM behavior:

1. Fixation (upper bound)

LLM-only behavior tends to converge toward θ → 1.
SAFE-CSM prevents excessive fixation by applying a minimal downward correction.

2. Collapse (lower bound)

LLM-only behavior sinks toward θ → 0.
SAFE-CSM applies a minimal upward correction.

3. Directional Drift

LLM-only behavior trends beyond the stability band.
SAFE-CSM maintains θ within the 0.2–0.8 range.

5. SAFE Declaration

This framework adheres strictly to SAFE requirements:

No learning

No optimization

No adaptation

No internal access

No inference of internal mechanisms

All functions fixed or randomized

Evaluation-only, observation-only

SAFE-CSM is a non-generative, non-controlling module.

Implementation support for SAFE-CSM (Industry/LLM Edition) requires an NDA to prevent misconfiguration or unintended use.
