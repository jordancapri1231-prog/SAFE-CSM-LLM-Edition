============================================================
1. Introduction
============================================================

The SAFE-CSM (LLM Edition) is a non-adaptive, external observation framework for analyzing contextual stability in large language model outputs.  
The method does not access or infer internal model operations.  
Instead, it evaluates observable variation in external signals through abstract stability indicators.

This edition focuses on providing a reproducible SAFE-layer evaluation tool that remains fully outside the internal mechanisms of LLMs.


============================================================
2. Design Overview
============================================================

SAFE-CSM (LLM Edition) uses:

- Six observable factors (J1–J6)
- A stability index Δφ
- A one-dimensional direction scalar θ ∈ [0, 1]
- A fixed SAFE correction band

All values are fixed or randomly generated.  
No learning or hidden-state inference is used.

The purpose is to illustrate:

- fixation-like behavior  
- drift tendencies  
- minimal stabilization using fixed corrections  


============================================================
3. Observable Factors and Stability Index
============================================================

The six observable factors:

  J1, J2, J3, J4, J5, J6

are external numerical indicators in the range [-1, 1].  
They have no relationship to internal neural representations.

Δφ is defined as:

    Δφ = J_affect – J_reflex

where:

- J_affect = J3  
- J_reflex = J6  

Δφ is an abstract observable index for characterizing drift.


============================================================
4. θ as a One-Dimensional Output-Direction Scalar
============================================================

The scalar θ ∈ [0, 1] represents:

- θ → 0 : fixation-like behaviors  
- θ → 1 : drift-like behaviors  

The LLM-only update introduces small random variation and slight directional tendencies to illustrate typical instability patterns.  
No internal model behavior is referenced.


============================================================
5. SAFE-CSM Correction
============================================================

SAFE-CSM applies a minimal, predefined correction only when θ leaves a stability band:

- below LOW  → nudged upward  
- above HIGH → nudged downward  

The correction EPS is small and fixed.  
This feature illustrates how small, external-only adjustments can maintain observable stability without modifying internal model logic.


============================================================
6. Demonstration Procedure
============================================================

The demonstration script:

1. Initializes θ = 0.5  
2. Applies LLM-only update  
3. Applies SAFE-CSM correction  
4. Records θ for two sequences  
5. Visualizes drift and stabilization  


============================================================
7. SAFE Compliance
============================================================

SAFE-CSM (LLM Edition) meets all SAFE-layer requirements:

- No access to internal model parameters  
- No inference of internal mechanisms  
- No learning, training, or optimization  
- All parameters fixed  
- Non-adaptive and fully transparent  
- Observation-only behavior  

All functions and values are designed for safe demonstration.

This project includes reference implementations, plots, and documentation for reproducible evaluation of contextual stability in LLM systems.

Implementation support for SAFE-CSM (LLM Edition) requires an NDA to prevent misconfiguration or unintended use.
